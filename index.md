### CPSC 120

*  Lab 1
   
   Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite, because it intorduced me to the world of programming, even through the exercises seemed simple in retrospect, thry challenged me and required me to think deeply at the time.

*  Lab 7
   
   Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite, because it enables me to utilize programming code, particularly boolean and if-else statements, to analyze the game of blackjack. This involves identifying thr point values of each card and ultimately computing the sum of my hand.

*  Lab 8
   
   Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite, because it was my initial exposure to the concept of nesting loops. This new skill was put into practice when I successfully created a graph using code, which was an exciting accomplishment. Being able to use this fundamental coding technique gave me a great sence of satisfaction and motivated me to continue exploring more complex applications of loop nesting in my future coding endeavors.

### CPSC 120

*  Lab 1
   
   Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite, because it helped open me to the world of programming. Althought it seems simple now, it was really racking my brains at that time.

*  Lab 7
   
   Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite, because it allows me to use code to interpret the game of blackjack, and after we finished coding we can identifying the point of my cards and calculating the total sum of cards.

*  Lab 8
   
   lab 8, part 1 was a favorite, because this is my first contact with nesting loop, by doing this lab 8 J have better understanding of nesting loop, also through nesting loop I successfully created a graph with code.

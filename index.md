### CPSC 120

*  Lab 1
   
   Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite, it's a simple lab that requires writing a program to output "Hello World". Initially, I fouund it confusing to work with input and output. But, after completing the lab, I mastered using input and output and also became more familiar with terminal commands. Through this lab, I learned how to write, compile, and run programs correctly.

*  Lab 7
   
   Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite, because it allowed me to use programming code to simulate the game of blackjack, we utilized boolean and if-else statements to analyze the game of blackjack, which involved identifying the point values of each card and computing the sum. By completing this lab, I gained a deeper understanding of programming concepts such as conditional statements.

*  Lab 8
   
   Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite, because it was my initial exposure to the concept of nesting loops. This new skill was put into practice when I successfully created a graph using code, which was an exciting accomplishment. Being able to use this fundamental coding technique gave me a great sence of satisfaction and motivated me to continue exploring more complex applications of loop nesting in my future coding endeavors.
